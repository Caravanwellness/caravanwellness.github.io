A healthy gut microbiota requires a diverse range of nutrients, including fiber, prebiotics, and probiotics, to thrive. By consuming a balanced and nutritious diet, we can support a healthy gut-brain axis and positively impact our mental well-being. **The Impact of Macronutrients:** *   Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates are a vital energy source for the brain. Complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, provide a steady release of glucose into the bloodstream, supporting stable mood and energy levels. Avoiding refined carbohydrates and sugary foods helps prevent blood sugar spikes and crashes, which can negatively impact mood and contribute to mental health issues. *   Proteins: Proteins play a crucial role in the production of neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers in the brain that regulate mood and emotions.
