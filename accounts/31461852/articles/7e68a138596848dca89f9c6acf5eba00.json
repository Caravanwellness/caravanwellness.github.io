Stress releases a hormone called cortisol, which essentially tenses up our bodies and makes it more difficult for 'unessential' systems to do their work efficiently. As far as the digestive system goes, this means that when we're stressed, we're much more likely to experience things like indigestion, heartburn, and bloating. In addition, research has found that increased cortisol levels can also negatively affect gut health - in essence, it throws the balance of \"good\" and \"bad\" bacteria out of order. Since 70% of the immune system is located in the gut, an imbalance in the diverse bacterial ecosystem there can lead to significant issues in immunity.</p><p>Cortisol, often referred to as the \"stress hormone,\" is a natural response to stress. Its primary function is to prepare the body for a 'fight or flight' situation by redirecting resources away from non-essential functions, like digestion, and towards the systems that would help us escape a dangerous situation. While this mechanism is valuable in emergency situations, chronic stress can lead to consistently elevated cortisol levels, which take a toll on our digestive health.</p><p>When cortisol levels are high, blood flow to the digestive organs is reduced, which slows down digestion and can lead to discomfort.
