When a child grows up in an environment that feels unsafe, unpredictable, or emotionally overwhelming, those early experiences may carry forward into adulthood in subtle or significant ways. Childhood trauma does not always come from one specific event. It may include experiences such as ongoing emotional neglect, separation from caregivers, or exposure to conflict. Each person’s response may be different, and how someone processes these experiences often depends on their support systems, culture, and sense of safety at the time.

There might be a pattern of pulling away when things feel too vulnerable or, on the other hand, becoming very focused on meeting others’ needs in order to feel secure. These responses may have developed early as ways to stay connected or protect from further emotional pain. **2.
