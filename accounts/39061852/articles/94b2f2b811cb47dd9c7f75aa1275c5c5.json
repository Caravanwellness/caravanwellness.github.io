The body's response to stress involves a series of physiological changes, some of which can affect the heart over time. Understanding how stress influences heart health may help individuals take steps toward managing stress and improving overall wellbeing. **The Body's Stress Response** When a person experiences stress, the body's sympathetic nervous system is activated, triggering what is commonly known as the \"fight or flight\" response.
