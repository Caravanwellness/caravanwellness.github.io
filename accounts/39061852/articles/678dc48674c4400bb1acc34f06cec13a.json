While both involve disrupted breathing during sleep, they are not the same and can have different health implications. Understanding the differences between snoring and sleep apnea can help individuals seek the right treatment and improve their quality of sleep. **What is Snoring?** Snoring occurs when air flows through the throat, causing tissues in the throat to vibrate, which produces the sound of snoring. It is usually caused by the partial blockage of the upper airway and can be influenced by factors such as: * **Nasal congestion:** Allergies or colds can make it harder to breathe through the nose, leading to snoring. * **Mouth breathing:** Breathing through the mouth during sleep can cause snoring, especially if the airway is partially obstructed. * **Sleep position:** Sleeping on the back can cause the tongue and soft tissues in the throat to collapse and obstruct the airway. While snoring can be annoying, it is often not considered a health concern unless it is very loud or frequent. **What is Sleep Apnea?** Sleep apnea, on the other hand, is a more serious condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep.
