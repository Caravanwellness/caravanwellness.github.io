According to the World Health Organization, heart attacks and strokes account for over 80% of all cardiovascular-related deaths. Understanding the link between cholesterol and these life-threatening events can empower individuals to take proactive, preventative steps. **What Is Cholesterol?** Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance found in the blood. The body needs cholesterol to build cells and produce hormones, but an excess—particularly of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)—can be dangerous. **Plaque Formation and Atherosclerosis:** When LDL cholesterol levels are high, cholesterol can accumulate on the inner walls of arteries. This buildup forms plaque, which narrows and stiffens the arteries in a condition called atherosclerosis. Over time, this impairs blood flow and increases the risk of clots. **Heart Attacks: When Cholesterol Blocks the Heart** A heart attack (myocardial infarction) occurs when blood flow to the heart is blocked, often by a clot that forms when a plaque ruptures. The lack of oxygen damages heart tissue and can lead to serious complications or death. **Symptoms to Watch For:** Chest pain or discomfort, Shortness of breath, Pain in the arm, jaw, or neck, Nausea, lightheadedness, or fatigue. **Strokes: When Cholesterol Affects the Brain** A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted. There are two main types: **Ischemic stroke** (most common): Caused by a blood clot, often related to atherosclerosis. **Hemorrhagic stroke**: Caused by a ruptured blood vessel, sometimes due to high blood pressure linked to poor cholesterol control. **Signs of Stroke (Act FAST):** **F**ace drooping, **A**rm weakness, **S**peech difficulty, **T**ime to call emergency services. **Prevention Through Lifestyle and Nutrition** Diet and lifestyle changes can dramatically reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke by improving cholesterol levels. **Proven Strategies Include:** **Choose Heart-Healthy Fats:** Replace saturated and trans fats with unsaturated fats from sources like nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil. **Boost Omega-3 Intake:** Fatty fish such as salmon and mackerel help lower triglycerides and reduce inflammation. **Add Soluble Fiber:** Oats, beans, lentils, and fruit can lower LDL cholesterol by binding to it in the digestive tract. **Avoid Processed Foods:** Cut back on trans fats and highly processed items that elevate LDL and lower HDL. **Limit Alcohol:** High alcohol intake can raise blood pressure and increase triglyceride levels, which are detrimental to cardiovascular health.
