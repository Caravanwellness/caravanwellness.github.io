Keeping your feet shoulder-width apart, your chest lifted, and your knees aligned with your toes can help ensure you’re targeting the right muscles and minimizing the risk of injury. Many athletes rely on squats to build lower body power and enhance athletic performance. When performing squats, it’s helpful to focus on the depth of the movement. Going lower in your squat can engage the glutes and hamstrings more effectively, contributing to improved strength and muscle development over time. **How Squats Contribute to Overall Fitness** Squats do more than just strengthen the legs and glutes—they also contribute to functional movement. The strength developed from squats can improve your ability to perform everyday tasks like bending, lifting, and climbing stairs with ease. Squats are incorporated into training regimens to support overall mobility and muscle endurance for functional fitness.
