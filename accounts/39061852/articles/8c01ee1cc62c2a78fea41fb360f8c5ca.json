It encourages a calm, nonjudgmental awareness of how and why we eat. By tuning into physical and emotional cues, individuals can begin to make more thoughtful choices that support long-term wellbeing. **Why We Eat & Recognizing The Triggers** Hunger is not always purely physical. People often eat in response to emotional triggers, stress, sadness, boredom, or even joy. While it’s normal for emotions to play a role in eating patterns, mindful eating encourages individuals to pause and reflect on what’s really happening in the body before reaching for food. **Practicing A Mindful Body Scan** A helpful exercise in mindful eating begins with a body scan. This process helps connect physical sensations with emotional cues and can be done in any comfortable position, sitting or lying down. - Taking a deep breath and slowly exhaling. - Noticing physical sensations starting from the feet and moving upward through the legs, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and neck. - Checking for signs of hunger, fullness, bloating, or tension. - Observing cravings or thoughts about food without judgment. This practice helps clarify whether hunger is physical or emotionally driven and supports more intentional food decisions. **Measuring Hunger With Awareness** A useful tool in mindful eating is rating hunger on a scale from 1 to 10: 1 = extremely hungry or lightheaded 10 = overly full or uncomfortable Identifying where one falls on this scale allows for more accurate meal timing and portion control. Over time, this practice builds trust in the body's natural hunger cues. **Emotional Eating vs. Physical Needs** Cravings for sugary or “comfort” foods are often tied to emotional needs.
