But while many people know their numbers, understanding what they actually mean is key to taking control of your cardiovascular health. **The Basics of a Cholesterol Test:** A standard **lipid panel** measures four main components: 1. Total Cholesterol 2. LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) – “Bad” Cholesterol 3. HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) – “Good” Cholesterol 4. Triglycerides **Total Cholesterol: The Big Picture** - **Ideal Range:** Below 200 mg/dL - **Borderline High:** 200–239 mg/dL - **High:** 240 mg/dL and above Total cholesterol represents the sum of your LDL, HDL, and a portion of your triglycerides. While it gives an overview, it’s most useful when evaluated alongside other values. **LDL Cholesterol: The “Bad” Cholesterol** - **Optimal:** Less than 100 mg/dL - **Near Optimal:** 100–129 mg/dL - **Borderline High:** 130–159 mg/dL - **High:** 160–189 mg/dL - **Very High:** 190 mg/dL and above LDL cholesterol is a major contributor to plaque buildup in the arteries, a condition called atherosclerosis.
