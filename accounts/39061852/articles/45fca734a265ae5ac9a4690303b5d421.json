From early adulthood to later years, staying aware of key areas for health screening and lifestyle habits may support long-term wellbeing. **In Your 20s and 30s** These decades can be a good time to build strong health habits and address any early concerns. * **General check-ups**: An annual physical may help monitor blood pressure, cholesterol, and weight. * **Mental well-being**: Discussing stress, anxiety, or mood changes with a provider might be helpful. * **Sexual health**: Routine testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and open conversations about reproductive goals may support overall wellness. * **Lifestyle focus**: Balanced eating, physical activity, and limiting tobacco or alcohol use can be beneficial. **In Your 40s and 50s** Health screenings often become more central during this time as risk factors for certain conditions may increase. * **Heart health**: Blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose levels may be monitored regularly. * **Prostate and colon screening**: Depending on family history and guidance from a healthcare provider, screening may begin in this age range. * **Vision and hearing**: Some individuals notice changes in vision or hearing, which may be addressed early. * **Muscle and joint health**: Supportive activity and stretching might help with flexibility and strength. **In Your 60s and Beyond** Later years may involve more focus on managing chronic conditions and maintaining independence. * **Bone density checks**: Osteoporosis may affect men as well, especially with certain risk factors. * **Cognitive and memory screening**: Early recognition of changes can support planning and care. * **Vaccinations**: Keeping up with recommended vaccines, including flu and shingles, might reduce preventable illness. * **Mobility and balance**: Activities that support coordination and stability may reduce the risk of falls.
