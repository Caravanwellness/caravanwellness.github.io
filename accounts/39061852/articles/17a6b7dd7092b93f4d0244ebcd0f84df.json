What apps do you use most? Are they work-related apps? Social media apps? Tracking how much time you spend on various applications can provide clarity about your digital habits. For example, productivity apps such as email or task managers may be essential for staying organized, but social media apps may take up more time than you realize.

For example, apps that allow you to connect with others, such as messaging platforms or community-based forums, can provide a sense of belonging and support. On the other hand, some social media platforms or news apps may evoke feelings of stress, comparison, or anxiety. Even work-related apps, while essential for staying organized, can feel overwhelming or distracting when used outside of working hours, disrupting your ability to unwind.</p><p><strong>Recognizing the Impact of Phone Use When You&rsquo;re Away</strong></p><p>Another essential aspect of healthy phone use is recognizing how you feel when you&rsquo;re away from your phone.
