This article explores natural methods and lifestyle adjustments to help manage acid reflux effectively. **Understanding Acid Reflux** Acid reflux occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a ring of muscle between the esophagus and stomach, relaxes or becomes weak, allowing stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus.
