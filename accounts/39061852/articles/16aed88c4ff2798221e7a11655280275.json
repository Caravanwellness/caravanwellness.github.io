Understanding your BMI can offer insight into your overall health and help you take informed, proactive steps toward preventing chronic diseases. **Understanding BMI** BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared (kg/m²). The result places you in one of the following categories: * **Underweight:** Below 18.5 * **Normal weight:** 18.5–24.9 * **Overweight:** 25–29.9 * **Obese:** 30 or higher While BMI doesn’t differentiate between fat and muscle, it is a useful screening tool for identifying potential weight-related health risks. **Why BMI Matters** High BMI is associated with: * **Heart disease** * **High blood pressure** * **Type 2 diabetes** * **Sleep apnea** * **Certain cancers** Meanwhile, a very low BMI may indicate malnutrition, hormonal imbalance, or underlying health conditions, including bone loss and weakened immunity. **Making Sense of Your Numbers** Knowing your BMI should be part of a broader picture of health.
