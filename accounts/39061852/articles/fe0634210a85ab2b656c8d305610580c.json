The World Health Organization estimates that more than 1.2 billion people live with elevated blood pressure, often unaware of the damage it's causing. **Understanding High Blood Pressure** Blood pressure is the force of circulating blood against the walls of your arteries. It’s measured using two numbers: - **Systolic pressure** (top number)**:** Pressure when the heart beats - **Diastolic pressure** (bottom number)**:** Pressure when the heart rests between beats A normal blood pressure reading is below 120/80 mmHg. Readings consistently at or above 130/80 mmHg indicate hypertension, which significantly increases the risk of damage to key organs—especially the heart, brain, and kidneys. **Effects on the Heart:** High blood pressure forces the heart to work harder than normal to pump blood. Over time, this can lead to: - **Enlarged heart muscle (left ventricular hypertrophy):** Reduces the heart’s efficiency and increases the risk of heart failure. - **Coronary artery damage:** High pressure can damage artery walls, leading to plaque buildup and atherosclerosis – a condition in which plaque builds up in the arteries. - **Increased risk of heart attack and heart failure:** Chronic strain and reduced blood flow due to narrowed arteries can cause significant heart damage. **Effects on the Brain:** The brain relies on a healthy, steady supply of oxygen-rich blood. When blood pressure is too high, it can lead to: - **Stroke:** Hypertension is the leading cause of ischemic strokes (caused by blocked arteries) and hemorrhagic strokes (caused by ruptured vessels). - **Cognitive decline:** Ongoing high blood pressure can lead to narrowed and damaged vessels in the brain, reducing blood flow and contributing to vascular dementia and memory loss. - **Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs):** Often referred to as “mini-strokes,” these temporary blockages are warning signs of more severe strokes to come. **Effects on the Kidneys:** Your kidneys filter waste and excess fluids from the blood—a task that requires healthy, low-pressure blood flow. High blood pressure can: - **Damage kidney arteries:** Narrowed or hardened arteries reduce blood flow, impairing kidney function. - **Chronic kidney disease:** Uncontrolled hypertension can result in kidney failure, requiring dialysis or transplant. - **Accelerated kidney decline in people with diabetes or existing kidney issues.** **Lifestyle Strategies for Blood Pressure Control** Taking control of high blood pressure begins with daily choices.
