Whether someone is monitoring their own mental wellness or observing changes in someone they care about, knowing what to look for is key. **What Is A Mental Health Crisis?** A mental health crisis occurs when a person’s emotional or psychological state escalates beyond their ability to manage daily life. At this point, they may be at risk of harming themselves or others. Crises can arise suddenly or develop gradually over time, and may require urgent action to support the person’s safety and wellbeing. **Warning Signs To Look Out For** The signs of a mental health crisis are not always easy to detect. However, some behaviors and emotional changes can serve as important indicators, including: * A sudden shift in mood, such as intense sadness, agitation, or irritability * Withdrawal from social interactions or activities the person used to enjoy * Verbal expressions of hopelessness, worthlessness, or feeling like a burden * Neglecting personal hygiene or daily responsibilities * Reckless or self-destructive behavior * Speaking about death or suicide, either directly or indirectly Not all crises involve suicidal thoughts, but this is one of the most serious warning signs and should never be ignored. **Immediate Response Steps** When someone appears to be experiencing a mental health crisis, the first step is to stay calm. Panic can escalate the situation. Instead, approach the person with empathy, listen without judgment, and validate what they are feeling. If they are open to it, encourage them to talk about what’s going on. In situations where a person’s safety is at risk—such as if they mention suicidal thoughts or have a plan to harm themselves or others—emergency support may be necessary. This can include contacting crisis services, a trusted healthcare provider, or taking them to the nearest emergency room. **Creating A Supportive Environment** A person in crisis may not always ask for help. Being a consistent presence, checking in regularly, and offering support without pushing can make a difference. Remind them that they are not alone and that professional help is available. For those living with or caring for someone with ongoing mental health challenges, creating a safety plan ahead of time can also be helpful.
