Between gifts, decorations, travel, and entertaining, it’s easy to feel like celebrating means spending more than you can afford. But meaningful holidays don’t require a big budget. With a little planning and intention, it’s possible to create a joyful season that doesn’t strain your wallet—or your wellbeing. Start by asking yourself: What do I value most during the holidays? Is it connection, tradition, creativity, or rest? When you define what matters most to you, it becomes easier to align your spending—and your time—with those priorities. **Set A Realistic Budget (And Stick To It)** Before making any purchases, decide what you can afford overall.
