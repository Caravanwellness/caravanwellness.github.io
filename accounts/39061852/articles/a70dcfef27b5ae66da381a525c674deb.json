The chemicals in tobacco harm nearly every organ, leading to severe and lasting health consequences for smokers and those exposed to second-hand smoke. Understanding these links highlights the importance of reducing tobacco use and seeking support for cessation. **Cardiovascular Diseases** Smoking significantly affects the heart and circulatory system, increasing the risk of: * **Heart Disease**: Tobacco damages blood vessels and raises blood pressure, making smokers twice as likely to develop coronary artery disease. * **Stroke**: Smoking contributes to plaque buildup in arteries and blood clot formation, both of which can lead to strokes. * **Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)**: This condition, involving reduced blood flow to limbs, is more common among smokers, often resulting in pain, mobility issues, and severe complications like amputation. **Respiratory Diseases** The lungs are among the most directly affected organs, with smoking being a major cause of: * **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**: Smoking damages airways and lung tissue, leading to conditions like emphysema and chronic bronchitis.
