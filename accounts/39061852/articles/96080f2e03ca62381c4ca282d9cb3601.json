While helpful, BMI doesn’t tell the full story. Knowing your body composition can provide deeper insights into your true health status. **Understanding Body Composition** Body composition refers to the proportion of fat, muscle, bone, and water in your body. Two people can have the same BMI but very different health risks if one carries more body fat and less lean muscle. **Key elements of body composition include:** * **Body fat percentage**: The proportion of fat in your body. * **Lean mass**: Includes muscles, bones, organs, and fluids. * **Visceral fat**: Fat stored around internal organs, which is more harmful than subcutaneous fat. **Why It Matters More Than BMI** BMI doesn’t differentiate between fat and muscle. A fit athlete and a sedentary individual may have the same BMI, but vastly different health profiles. Focusing solely on weight can overlook: * **Sarcopenic obesity** (normal weight but high body fat, low muscle) * **Skinny fat** profiles (low BMI, but poor muscle-to-fat ratio) * **Metabolic risks hidden in \"normal\" weight ranges** **Improving Body Composition Through Lifestyle** Strategies to improve overall body composition include: 1. **Prioritize Protein and Healthy Fats:** Incorporate lean protein (like poultry, legumes, tofu, or fish) to support muscle repair and growth.
