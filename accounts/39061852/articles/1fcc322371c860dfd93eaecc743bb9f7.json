The intricacies between these two pillars of health is supported by robust scientific evidence, highlighting their synergistic effects on various physiological and psychological aspects of our overall wellbeing. * **Cognitive Function and Nutrient Intake:** Nutrition plays a pivotal role in supporting cognitive function. Essential nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals, contribute to neuroplasticity and neurotransmitter synthesis.
