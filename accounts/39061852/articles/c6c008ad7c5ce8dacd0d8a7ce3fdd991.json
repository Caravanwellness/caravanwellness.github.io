It is a vital sign that provides insight into your cardiovascular health. BP is measured using a device called a sphygmomanometer (pronounced; “sfig-moh-muh-nom-uh-ter”), which records two numbers: systolic pressure (the pressure when the heart beats) **over** diastolic pressure (the pressure when the heart rests between beats). These numbers are expressed in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), such and are documented as 120/80 mm Hg or spoken “120 over 80”. In this example. 120 represents the systolic and 80 represents the diastolic. **Understanding the Numbers** * **Normal Blood Pressure:** A normal blood pressure reading is typically around 120/80 mm Hg. Individuals with normal blood pressure generally feel well and do not experience symptoms related to blood pressure. * **High Blood Pressure (Hypertension):** A reading of 140/90 mm Hg or higher is considered high.
