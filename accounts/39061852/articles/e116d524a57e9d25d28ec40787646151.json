An increasing number of older adults use walking aids, with estimates suggesting that nearly 1 in 10 adults over the age of 65 rely on one. When used correctly, these devices significantly enhance safety and mobility—whether indoors or outdoors. **Understanding the Purpose of Walking Aids:** Canes and walkers provide additional support for balance, stability, and weight-bearing. They are often recommended for people recovering from injury, managing chronic conditions like arthritis, or experiencing general muscle weakness or unsteadiness. However, incorrect use or poor fit can lead to discomfort—or even increase fall risk—making proper technique essential. **Choose the Right Device:** Selecting the proper mobility aid depends on your specific needs. * **Canes** offer support on one side and are ideal for those with minor balance or strength issues. * **Walkers** provide more comprehensive support and are better suited for those who require assistance on both sides of the body or need help bearing weight. **Ensure Proper Fit:** A cane or walker that is too tall or too short can cause posture problems or reduce stability. * **Check Height:** When standing upright, the handle should align with the crease of your wrist. Your elbow should be slightly bent (about 15–20 degrees) when gripping the handle. * **Consult a Professional:** Ask your doctor or physical therapist to help assess the best fit and type for your needs. **Use the Correct Walking Technique:** * **Using a Cane:** Hold the cane in the hand opposite the weaker or injured leg. Move the cane forward at the same time as the weaker leg, then step through with the stronger leg. * **Using a Walker:** * Move the walker a short distance ahead, then step forward with the weaker leg first, followed by the stronger leg. Avoid placing the walker too far forward. * **Stay Upright and Look Ahead:** Keep your back straight and look ahead—not down—while walking. This helps maintain good posture and allows you to spot obstacles early. **Tips for Safe Use of Canes and Walkers:** * **Clear Walking Paths at Home:** Eliminate clutter, loose rugs, and cords in your walking areas to prevent tripping. Ensure that your mobility aid can pass easily through doorways and hallways. * **Be Cautious on Stairs and Uneven Surfaces:** Never use a walker on stairs.
