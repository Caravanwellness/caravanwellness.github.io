More than 37 million falls each year require medical attention, and many are preventable by identifying and addressing home-based risk factors. **Understanding Home-Related Falls**: A fall is typically caused by a combination of factors, and the home can present hidden hazards. Everyday routines, when paired with environmental risks and physical changes related to aging, can lead to slips, trips, or loss of balance. Understanding why falls happen at home is the first step toward prevention. **Common Home Hazards That Lead to Falls**: Poor Lighting: Insufficient lighting, especially in hallways, staircases, and bathrooms, makes it difficult to see obstacles or uneven surfaces. Dim lighting can delay reaction time and increase the likelihood of tripping. Cluttered Walkways: Loose cords, scattered rugs, piles of magazines, or misplaced shoes can obstruct walking paths and create tripping hazards. Keeping pathways clear is essential for safety. Slippery Surfaces: Bathroom floors, kitchen tiles, and entryways can become dangerously slippery when wet. These areas are common sites for falls, particularly after bathing or during cleaning. Lack of Handrails and Grab Bars: Stairs without sturdy handrails and bathrooms without grab bars near toilets and tubs leave individuals without essential support when navigating or transitioning positions. Loose or Unstable Rugs: Throw rugs or carpets that shift or bunch can cause unexpected trips. Non-slip backings or removal of loose rugs altogether is a safer alternative. Inappropriate Footwear: Wearing socks on smooth floors, or shoes without adequate grip or support, can lead to instability. Slippers or shoes with non-skid soles are a safer choice for indoor use.

Install Safety Equipment: Grab bars in the bathroom, railings on both sides of staircases, and shower chairs can provide crucial support. Secure Rugs and Mats: Use non-slip backing or rug tape, or eliminate rugs altogether to reduce tripping risks. Reorganize Storage: Place frequently used items at waist height to avoid the need for reaching, bending, or climbing. Wear Supportive Footwear: Encourage the use of non-slip, supportive shoes or slippers indoors—avoid walking in socks on hard floors. Stay Active to Support Balance and Strength: Engage in regular physical activity to maintain muscle tone, coordination, and flexibility—all of which support safer movement at home. By taking proactive steps to identify and minimize hazards in the home, individuals can significantly reduce their risk of falling. Small changes to the living environment can have a powerful impact on safety, confidence, and independence. **References**: World Health Organization (WHO). (2023).
