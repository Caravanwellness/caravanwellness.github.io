It is an umbrella term that encompasses several specific diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of dementia cases. Understanding the distinction between general dementia and Alzheimer’s disease is crucial for diagnosis and management. **Dementia: A Broad Overview** Dementia is characterized by a decline in memory, reasoning, and other cognitive abilities that impacts daily functioning. It can result from various underlying conditions, including: * **Vascular Dementia**: Caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, often due to strokes or other vascular issues. * **Lewy Body Dementia**: Involves abnormal protein deposits (Lewy bodies) affecting cognition, movement, and visual hallucinations. * **Frontotemporal Dementia**: Affects the frontal and temporal lobes, leading to changes in personality, behavior, and language. **Alzheimer’s Disease: A Specific Type** Alzheimer’s disease is a specific type of dementia that primarily affects the brain’s memory and cognitive functions. It is characterized by: * **Amyloid Plaques**: Abnormal protein clumps between brain cells. * **Tau Tangles**: Twisted protein fibers inside brain cells that disrupt their function. * **Gradual Onset**: Typically starts with subtle memory loss and progresses to more severe cognitive decline. **Comparing and Contrasting Stages** * **Dementia Stages**: Dementia generally progresses through stages of mild, moderate, and severe.
