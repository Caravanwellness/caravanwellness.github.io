Urban environments, filled with noise and constant stimuli, can lead to cognitive fatigue, making it difficult to focus and process thoughts. Nature, on the other hand, offers a tranquil setting that allows the mind to reset.

Nature&rsquo;s quiet and soothing qualities allow individuals to detach from worries and intrusive thoughts, which are often the root causes of anxiety and rumination.
