Though gestational diabetes is temporary and generally resolves after childbirth, it requires careful monitoring and management to ensure the health and safety of both the mother and baby.</p><p>During pregnancy, hormonal changes can interfere with the body's insulin function. The placenta, which nourishes the growing baby, produces hormones that can increase insulin resistance, making it harder for the body to regulate blood sugar levels. Normally, the pancreas compensates by producing more insulin, but in some cases, it is unable to keep up, resulting in high blood sugar levels.</p><p>Unlike type 1 or type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes does not cause permanent damage to the pancreas or require lifelong management. However, the condition can lead to complications if left untreated.
