This article explores the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and effective management strategies for hypothyroidism. **What is Hypothyroidism?** Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland, located in the neck, does not produce sufficient thyroid hormones—triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). These hormones regulate metabolism, energy production, and various bodily functions. Insufficient thyroid hormone levels can slow down the body's processes, leading to a range of symptoms. **Causes and Risk Factors** Several factors can contribute to hypothyroidism: * **Autoimmune Thyroiditis (Hashimoto's Thyroiditis)**: The most common cause in developed countries, where the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland. * **Iodine Deficiency**: Inadequate intake of iodine, a mineral essential for thyroid hormone production. * **Thyroid Surgery or Radioactive Iodine Treatment**: Medical interventions that affect thyroid function. * **Medications**: Some medications, such as lithium or amiodarone, can interfere with thyroid hormone production. **Symptoms of Hypothyroidism** * **Fatigue** * **Weight gain** * **Cold intolerance** * **Dry skin** * **Constipation** * **Hair loss** * **Depression** * **Muscle weakness** **Diagnosis Options** * **Thyroid Function Tests**: Blood tests measure levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and T4.
