According to U.S. public health data from 2021, approximately 352,000 individuals under the age of 20 were diagnosed with diabetes. While there are two primary types—type 1 and type 2—this article focuses on type 1, which is more common among younger individuals. **Type 1 vs. Type 2 Diabetes** Both types of diabetes involve problems with insulin, a hormone that plays a vital role in helping the body use sugar for energy. However, the causes and mechanisms differ: * Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas produces little to no insulin. Without insulin, sugar cannot enter cells and instead builds up in the bloodstream. * Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, typically affects adults and is linked to insulin resistance. The body still produces insulin, but the cells do not respond to it properly, often due to obesity and other lifestyle factors. In children and teens, type 1 diabetes is significantly more common. **Recognizing Symptoms Of Type 1 Diabetes** Early identification is critical. Common signs include: * Excessive thirst (polydipsia) * Frequent urination (polyuria) * Unexplained weight loss * Increased hunger * Fatigue or low energy * Irritability or mood swings * Blurred vision These symptoms occur because sugar cannot enter the cells to be used for energy and instead accumulates in the blood. **Treatment Approaches** There is currently no cure for type 1 diabetes, but it can be managed effectively with insulin and lifestyle adjustments. **Insulin Therapy** Insulin must be given daily to manage blood sugar. There are two main methods: * **Insulin pumps:** A small device inserted under the skin, typically worn on the abdomen or upper arm. It delivers insulin as needed based on real-time blood glucose monitoring. * **Manual injections:** If a pump is not available, insulin can be given using a syringe or pen following regular finger-prick blood glucose tests throughout the day. **Supporting Lifestyle Habits** Blood sugar management is not limited to medication. Important factors include: * Regular physical activity * Balanced meals * Sufficient sleep * Stress management and relaxation These habits help stabilize blood sugar and support overall health. **Handling Emergencies** Blood sugar can sometimes drop or rise to dangerous levels, requiring urgent attention. * **Low Blood Sugar (Hypoglycemia):** Signs of dangerously low blood sugar include faintness or unconsciousness. In such cases: Injectable glucagon is recommended to raise blood sugar levels quickly. This is typically administered in a medical setting. If glucagon is not available, sugary fluids like fruit juice can offer a rapid alternative. Emergency medical attention may be necessary if symptoms do not improve quickly. **High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia)** In the case of severe high blood sugar: Fast-acting insulin is used to bring levels down. If insulin is unavailable or symptoms worsen, emergency services should be contacted immediately. Hospital treatment may be needed. Type 1 diabetes requires daily attention and care, but with the right tools and support, children and teens can manage the condition successfully. Monitoring symptoms, maintaining healthy routines, and being prepared for emergencies are key to helping young individuals live well with type 1 diabetes. *For information purposes only.
