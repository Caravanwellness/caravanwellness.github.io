It is integral to various bodily functions, including muscle repair and growth, immune function, hormone production, and enzyme activity. Understanding the importance of protein and incorporating it into a balanced diet can have significant benefits for overall health. **What is Protein?** Proteins are large molecules made up of amino acids, often referred to as the building blocks of life. There are 20 different amino acids, nine of which are essential because the body cannot produce them on its own and must obtain them from food sources. Protein sources are classified into two main categories: complete proteins, which contain all essential amino acids, and incomplete proteins, which lack one or more essential amino acids. **Functions of Protein in the Body** 1. **Muscle Health**: Protein is crucial for building and repairing muscles. During physical activity or exercise, muscle fibers undergo microscopic damage. Protein consumption helps repair these fibers, leading to muscle growth and strength. 2. ** Immune Function**: Many antibodies and immune system cells are made up of proteins. Adequate protein intake supports the immune system's ability to defend against infections and illnesses. 3. **Enzymes and Hormones**: Proteins serve as catalysts for biochemical reactions (enzymes) and are involved in hormone production and regulation.
