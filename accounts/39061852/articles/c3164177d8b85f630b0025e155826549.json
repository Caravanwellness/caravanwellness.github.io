Falls are the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide. While prevention is key, knowing what to do after a fall can make a critical difference in minimizing injury, reducing fear, and speeding recovery. **Understanding the Importance of Fall Response:** Even a minor fall can lead to injuries such as sprains, fractures, or head trauma. In some cases, panic or attempting to get up too quickly can worsen the situation. By learning how to assess your condition, call for help, and rise safely, you can take charge in a vulnerable moment and avoid further harm. **Steps to Take After a Fall:** **1. Stay Calm and Assess for Injury:** Take a few deep breaths to stay calm. Before moving, check for pain, bleeding, or anything that feels “off,” especially in your hips, back, head, or limbs. * If you feel pain or suspect a broken bone, do not try to get up on your own. Stay where you are and call for help. * If you''re not seriously hurt, take your time before trying to move. **2. Call for Help if Needed:** If you’'re unable to get up or are in pain, call your local emergency hotline or press your medical alert button if you have one. * Use your phone, call out to someone nearby, or bang on the wall or floor to get attention. * Keep a phone or alert system within easy reach in key areas of your home—especially near the bed and bathroom. **3. Get Up Safely (If You’'re Able):** If you’'re not injured and feel strong enough to rise, use the following steps: * **Roll onto your side** and rest for a moment. * **Get onto your hands and knees.** * **Crawl to a stable piece of furniture** (like a chair or couch). * **Use your hands to brace yourself** and place one foot flat on the floor. * **Slowly rise to a seated position** on the furniture before standing.
