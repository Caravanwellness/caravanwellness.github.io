Two of the most important metrics are your fasting blood sugar and A1C level. Understanding both can give you greater control over your health and help you prevent long-term complications. **What Is Fasting Blood Sugar?** Fasting blood sugar is the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood after going without food for at least 8 hours—typically measured in the morning. It provides a snapshot of how the body is managing blood sugar at a single point in time. * A normal fasting blood sugar is typically around 100 mg/dL or lower * After consuming sugary or carbohydrate-rich foods, levels may rise temporarily—sometimes over 200 mg/dL * In cases of undiagnosed or poorly managed diabetes, levels can rise to 400 mg/dL or more * Since blood sugar can vary throughout the day, fasting levels are useful but don’t reveal long-term trends. **What Is A1C?** A1C, or hemoglobin A1C, reflects the average blood sugar level over the past 90 days. This longer-term view helps identify patterns and overall control rather than fluctuations from one moment to the next. **A1C Ranges:** * Below 5.7% – Normal * 5.7% to 6.4% – Prediabetes * 6.5% or higher – Diabetes * 6.7% to 7.0% – Indicates diabetes is reasonably well-controlled * 8.0% or higher – Suggests blood sugar is not well-managed Even in the absence of symptoms, high A1C levels can contribute to silent damage in blood vessels and organs. **How A1C Affects Eye Health** A1C is especially important in relation to eye health. Elevated blood sugar can weaken or damage the small vessels in the retina, potentially leading to diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of vision loss. For individuals with an A1C between 6.5% and 7.0% and no signs of eye damage, an annual eye exam is typically appropriate. When A1C is 10% or higher, even with a normal eye exam, more frequent monitoring every 6 months may be recommended due to the higher risk of silent retinal changes. This same risk of microvascular damage applies to other areas as well, including the feet, kidneys, and cardiovascular system. **Tracking Numbers Over Time** Keeping track of both fasting blood sugar and A1C can help individuals and healthcare providers make better decisions. A small notebook or digital tracker can be used to log: * The number * The date and time * Whether the measurement was fasting or post-meal Tracking empowers individuals to recognize patterns, monitor progress, and protect their long-term health—especially vision. **For information purposes only.
