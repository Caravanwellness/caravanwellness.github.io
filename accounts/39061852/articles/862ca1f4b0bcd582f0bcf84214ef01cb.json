This article explores the potential impact of GLP-1 on mental health, highlighting current findings and considerations. **Understanding GLP-1 and its Mechanisms** GLP-1 is a hormone produced in the gut in response to food intake. Its primary role is to stimulate insulin release, regulate blood sugar levels, and promote feelings of fullness. GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic the effects of this hormone, leading to improved glucose control and aiding in weight loss by reducing appetite and promoting satiety. **Potential Impact on Mental Health** * **Mood Regulation:** Research suggests that GLP-1 receptor agonists may have neuroprotective effects and could potentially influence mood regulation.
