It’s often overlooked, misunderstood, or simply never discussed. Both men and women have a pelvic floor, and learning about how it works is the first step to better bladder, bowel, and sexual health. **What Is The Pelvic Floor?** The pelvic floor is made up of layers of small but powerful muscles that sit inside and around the pelvis. These muscles support essential functions, including: Bladder control Bowel movements Sexual function Core and pelvic stability during movement The pelvic floor has both external and internal layers. In total, there are three main layers, each with different roles in relaxation, contraction, and coordination. **Why It Matters** These muscles work automatically for many of us—until something disrupts their function. Just like muscles in the shoulders or back, pelvic floor muscles can develop tightness, weakness, or trigger points (commonly referred to as muscle knots). These issues can arise from: Physical or surgical trauma (like C-sections or abdominal surgeries) Chronic tension or stress Changes in daily habits Sexual trauma **Common Signs Of Pelvic Floor Dysfunction:** Painful bowel movements Discomfort or pain during sexual activity Burning sensation while urinating without a urinary tract infection Increased urinary urgency or frequency Constipation that doesn’t resolve with typical dietary changes In many cases, individuals experience symptoms for years before discovering that the pelvic floor may be involved. **Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy: What To Expect** If you’ve never had a pelvic floor evaluation before, it typically involves a detailed assessment of how these muscles are working. A pelvic floor physical therapist will examine muscle tone, strength, coordination, and your ability to contract and relax these muscles properly. One common issue is high tone—a condition where the pelvic floor muscles remain too tight. This can lead to urinary discomfort, difficulty with bowel movements, and painful intercourse. On the other hand, weakness or poor coordination in the pelvic floor can contribute to urinary incontinence, frequent urges, and constipation. **Can You Retrain Your Bladder?** Yes. Many people develop habits over time that “train” their bladder to respond a certain way. For example: Urgently needing to use the bathroom as soon as you get home Going “just in case” before leaving the house, entering a store, or arriving at appointments Over time, these behaviors condition the bladder to become overly sensitive and reduce its ability to hold urine normally. With guided pelvic floor therapy, it's possible to retrain your bladder and restore a more manageable and natural pattern. **Constipation & The Pelvic Floor** Chronic constipation isn’t always about diet. It can be linked to: Stress and nervous system dysregulation Tight pelvic muscles that make it difficult to fully evacuate Poor muscle coordination or weakness Pelvic floor physical therapy addresses these underlying causes by teaching patients how to relax the muscles effectively, improve posture, and use targeted techniques to support better digestion and elimination.
