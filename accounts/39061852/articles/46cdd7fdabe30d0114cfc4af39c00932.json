Changes in oral health, medical conditions, and lifestyle factors can all contribute to your risk of tooth decay. Consider these tips for identifying risk factors and adopting habits to help prevent tooth decay in later years. **Why Older Adults May Face Higher Risks** - **Dry Mouth**: Reduced saliva production, often caused by medications or certain health conditions, can make it harder for the mouth to naturally wash away food particles and bacteria. - **Gum Recession**: Gums may recede with age, exposing tooth roots that are more vulnerable to decay. - **Weakened Tooth Enamel**: Decades of wear can lead to thinner enamel, making teeth more susceptible to cavities. - **Dietary Changes**: Diets high in sugar or starchy foods, or those that are limited in nutrients, can increase the risk of decay. - **Dental Restorations**: Crowns, bridges, or fillings may develop cracks or gaps over time, creating areas where decay can begin. - **Difficulty with Oral Care**: Conditions like arthritis, which limit dexterity, can make thorough brushing and flossing more difficult. **Suggestions For Preventing Tooth Decay** - **Maintaining Oral Hygiene**: Using a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste can help protect tooth enamel and remove plaque.
