            "content": "**What Does Low Blood Pressure Mean?** Blood pressure is a vital sign of cardiovascular health. Understanding what low blood pressure means—and when it becomes a concern—is essential for supporting overall wellbeing. **Understanding Blood Pressure Readings:** Blood pressure is measured using two numbers: - **Systolic pressure** (top number): Pressure in the arteries when the heart beats - **Diastolic pressure** (bottom number): Pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats A normal reading is typically around 120/80 mmHg. Low blood pressure is generally considered to be 90/60 mmHg or lower. **When Is Low Blood Pressure a Concern?** Low blood pressure is not always problematic—especially for healthy individuals with no symptoms. However, when blood pressure drops too low, the brain and other vital organs may not receive enough oxygenated blood. Symptoms may include: - Dizziness or lightheadedness - Blurred vision - Fainting - Fatigue - Nausea - Cold, clammy skin - Rapid or shallow breathing In more serious cases, hypotension can cause shock, a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment. **Common Causes of Low Blood Pressure** There are several possible causes and types of hypotension: 1. **Dehydration:** Not drinking enough fluids can reduce blood volume and lead to a drop in pressure. 2. **Heart Problems:** Conditions like bradycardia (slow heart rate), heart failure, or heart valve issues can result in low pressure. 3. **Endocrine Disorders:** Thyroid problems, adrenal insufficiency, and low blood sugar can all contribute. 4. **Blood Loss or Severe Infection:** Significant bleeding or sepsis can cause dangerous drops in pressure. 5. **Medications:** Drugs for high blood pressure, depression, or Parkinson’s disease may lower blood pressure as a side effect. 6. **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Lack of nutrients like vitamin B12 and folate can interfere with red blood cell production, affecting pressure. 7. **Postural Hypotension:** A sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up quickly, common in older adults. **How Low Is Too Low?** The impact of low blood pressure varies from person to person. Some individuals may have readings as low as 85/55 mmHg and feel perfectly well. For others, a sudden drop from their normal range—even if still technically above 90/60—can lead to symptoms and should be evaluated. **Strategies for Managing Low Blood Pressure** Managing low blood pressure often focuses on fluid balance and circulation.
