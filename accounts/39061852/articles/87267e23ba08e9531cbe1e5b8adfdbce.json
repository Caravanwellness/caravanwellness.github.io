While commonly associated with aging, arthritis impacts individuals across all ages, genders, and backgrounds.</p><p>Though arthritis is often viewed as a condition primarily affecting older adults, it is not limited to this age group. Nearly 50% of adults aged 65 and older are diagnosed with arthritis, making it a leading cause of disability among seniors. However, arthritis also affects younger demographics. Juvenile arthritis, encompassing several autoimmune and inflammatory conditions affecting children, impacts around 300,000 kids under 18 in the United States. Younger adults can also develop arthritis, particularly due to injuries, genetic factors, or autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, which can appear as early as a person&rsquo;s 30s.</p><p>Women experience arthritis at higher rates than men, particularly with types such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Statistics show that nearly 60% of all arthritis cases are in women, who are twice as likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis. Hormonal and genetic factors are believed to influence this disparity. For instance, hormonal changes that occur during menopause may increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis in women.</p><p>Research highlights disparities in arthritis prevalence across racial and ethnic groups. African Americans and Hispanics report higher levels of severe arthritis-related pain and greater limitations in activity than white individuals. Indigenous populations also experience higher arthritis rates compared to the general population. Contributing factors may include access to healthcare, socioeconomic status, and cultural aspects affecting arthritis management.</p><p>Socioeconomic status can greatly influence arthritis prevalence and severity. Those in lower-income brackets may have limited access to healthcare resources, including early diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing care. This often leads to more severe symptoms, reduced physical function, and higher rates of disability. Studies show that individuals living in poverty are more likely to report arthritis-related limitations, such as difficulty walking or performing everyday tasks, compared to those with higher incomes.</p><p>Certain occupations that require repetitive motion, heavy lifting, or prolonged standing can increase the risk of developing arthritis. For example, individuals working in construction, farming, or factory settings may be more prone to joint injuries that contribute to arthritis later in life. Lifestyle factors like obesity and physical inactivity also play a significant role. Excess body weight puts additional stress on weight-bearing joints, such as the knees and hips, raising the risk of osteoarthritis. Research shows that obesity is a contributing factor in approximately one-third of arthritis cases.</p><p>Arthritis affects a diverse population, impacting individuals from childhood to senior years and spanning all genders, races, and socioeconomic backgrounds.
