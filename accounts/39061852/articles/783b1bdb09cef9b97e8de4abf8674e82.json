Each year, an estimated 37 million falls require medical attention worldwide. While many factors contribute to fall risk, changes in vision and hearing are often overlooked. Understanding and addressing sensory impairments can play a key role in fall prevention. **Understanding the Sensory Connection:** Vision and hearing are critical to how we navigate the world.

When either sense is impaired, the brain receives incomplete or inaccurate information, increasing the likelihood of a misstep or fall. As we age, natural changes in both sight and hearing can subtly impact stability, often without immediate awareness. **Sensory Strategies for Fall Prevention:** - **Schedule Regular Eye Exams:** Vision changes can occur gradually. Annual eye exams help detect and treat common conditions like cataracts, glaucoma, and macular degeneration—each of which can impact depth perception, clarity, and peripheral vision. - **Update Your Eyewear as Needed:** Ensure that prescription glasses are current and properly fitted.
