But while many sources urge people to get seven to eight hours of sleep each night, far fewer offer practical guidance on how to actually make that happen. That\u2019s where sleep hygiene comes in. Sleep hygiene refers to the habits and environment that support consistent, restful sleep. Here are some foundational tips that can help you fall asleep more easily and wake up feeling refreshed. **Keep Your Room Cool, Dark, & Quiet** Temperature matters more than many realize. Research shows that the optimal sleep temperature is typically between 64 and 69 degrees Fahrenheit. If that feels too cold, try starting around 70 and slowly adjusting over time. Use breathable blankets and consider a fan if air conditioning isn't ideal. Darkness is equally important. Melatonin, a hormone that regulates your sleep-wake cycle (or circadian rhythm), is released in response to darkness. Exposure to artificial light\u2014especially in the evening\u2014can suppress melatonin and make it harder to fall and stay asleep. **Limit Screen Exposure Before Bed** Screens emit blue light, which disrupts melatonin production. That includes phones, laptops, tablets, TVs, and even smartwatches. Beyond the light exposure, the content on these screens\u2014like the news or social media\u2014can also trigger stress, anxiety, or emotional stimulation that makes it harder to relax. If cutting screen time isn\u2019t realistic, here are a few workarounds: * Use blue light\u2013blocking glasses * Try clip-on amber lenses if you already wear glasses * Switch to an e-reader that doesn\u2019t emit light * Keep television viewing out of the bedroom These can help reduce the impact of screens when used mindfully. **Set Boundaries Around Evening Content** What you consume\u2014both visually and mentally\u2014before bed affects sleep. Scrolling through negative news stories or intense social media discussions can lead to what's often called \u201cdoom scrolling,\u201d which stimulates the nervous system and raises cortisol levels at a time when the body should be winding down. Instead, try: * Reading a physical book * Journaling * Listening to calming music or a guided meditation Choose evening habits that soothe rather than stimulate. Improving sleep hygiene doesn\u2019t require a complete life overhaul. Even small changes\u2014like cooling your room a few degrees, limiting light exposure, or reducing evening screen time\u2014can help your body shift into rest mode more naturally.
